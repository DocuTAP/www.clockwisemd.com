    <p>Hi - we are Tristan and Fred â€“ two members of the ClockwiseMD Product Team</p>

    <p>
      We will be managing the ClockwiseMD ideas portal.  We know that you took the time to provide us with your feedback, so we want you to know that we are looking at everything that you write and find your
      feedback invaluable.

      <p>
        <strong>Review new submissions every 2 weeks</strong> to do things like explore new feedback / merge redundant ideas / engage with our customers
        in the comment section if we need clarity or further explanation on the problem we are trying to solve / we may even rewrite ideas to ensure that they are positioned in the best possible way to garner more votes.
