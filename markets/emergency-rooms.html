    <h4>Online check-in designed for emergency departments.</h4>
    <p>
      A key focus for today's emergency departments (EDs) is balancing patient loads across peak
      and non-peak operating hours. To help manage the waiting process and prevent overcrowding,
      EDs are turning to Clockwise.MD. With online check-in and virtual queuing, EDs can
      streamline operations and gain access to increasingly important metrics on throughput,
      patient satisfaction, average wait times, and more.

            <h6>Defy emergency room perceptions.</h6>
            Give your emergency department a competitive advantage. ERs that post information about
            queue positioning are often perceived as more caring and more innovative than
            departments that do not provide transparency into the waiting process.

            <h6>Reduce "left without being seen."</h6>
            91% of patients indicate that waiting longer than expected is the most frustrating
            thing about medical facilities. Prevent patients from leaving in frustration by
            providing transparency into wait times. Text message notifications and an in-lobby TV
            keep patients up to date on wait times and queue order (in a HIPAA- compliant format).

            Optimize throughput based on live monitoring from Clockwise.MD. See where bottlenecks
            are occurring, make informed staffing decisions, and better understand where patients
            are spending their time. Get detailed benchmarks on patient wait times, wait times by
            day and hour, online appointments vs. walk-ins, ROI, and more.

            Allow patients to self-schedule fast track appointments online - and provide
            information about the cause of their visit. Patients will receive a text message
            notification when you're ready to see them. Not only does this help to manage patient
            expectations, it also helps your staff better identify fast-track patients.

            Get real-time data to help manage high- and low-acuity workflows. With Clockwise.MD,
            not only can you balance patient loads between peak and non-peak operating hours, but
            also between emergency departments and urgent cares. Ensure that low-acuity patients
            get the most immediate care by re-routing them to an in-network urgent care facility.

            <h6>Keep patients in network.</h6>
            Keep your patients in network through proactive staff or call-center scheduling of
            follow-ups and referrals. Actively monitor patient satisfaction, improve CAHPS hospital
            survey results, and mitigate negative experiences before any damage is done to your
            reputation.

            Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
            option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
            ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
            real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

            We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
            now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
            in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
            effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

            Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
            text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
            anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
            all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
            our wait times.

            I cant say enough about the survey functionality of clockwise and its part in our
            clinics' success. The text message survey allows us to respond in real time to patients
            to understand and ease the concerns of those who have had a less than stellar experience.
