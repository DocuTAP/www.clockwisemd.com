    <h3>Online check-in designed for emergency departments.</h3>
    <p>
      A key focus for today's emergency departments (EDs) is balancing patient loads across peak
      and non-peak operating hours. To help manage the waiting process and prevent overcrowding,
      EDs are turning to Clockwise.MD. With online check-in and
      <a href='/products/queue/'>virtual queuing</a>, EDs can streamline operations and gain access
      to increasingly important metrics on throughput, patient satisfaction, average wait times,
      and more.

            <h6>Defy emergency room perceptions.</h6>
            Give your emergency department a competitive advantage. ERs that post information about
            <a href='/products/queue/'>queue positioning</a> are often perceived as more caring and
            more innovative than departments that do not provide transparency into the waiting
            process.

          <div class="box-2">
            <h6>Reduce "left without being seen."</h6>
            91% of patients indicate that waiting longer than expected is the most frustrating
            thing about medical facilities. Prevent patients from leaving in frustration by
            providing transparency into wait times. Text message notifications and an in-lobby TV
            keep patients up to date on wait times and queue order (in a HIPAA- compliant format).

          <div class="box-3">
            <h6>Manage staff and workflows.</h6>
            Optimize throughput based on live monitoring from Clockwise.MD. See where bottlenecks
            are occurring, make informed staffing decisions, and better understand where patients
            are spending their time. Get detailed benchmarks on patient wait times, wait times by
            day and hour, online appointments vs. walk-ins, ROI, and more.

            <h6>Allow ER visitors to check in online.</h6>
            Allow patients to self-schedule fast track appointments online - and provide
            information about the cause of their visit. Patients will receive a text message
            notification when you're ready to see them. Not only does this help to manage patient
            expectations, it also helps your staff better identify fast-track patients.

            Get real-time data to help manage high- and low-acuity workflows. With Clockwise.MD,
            not only can you balance patient loads between peak and non-peak operating hours, but
            also between emergency departments and urgent cares. Ensure that low-acuity patients
            get the most immediate care by re-routing them to an in-network urgent care facility.
