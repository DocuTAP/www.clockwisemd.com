    <h3>Online self-scheduling and check-in for your urgent care clinic.</h3>
    <p>
      Over 1,300 urgent cares across the Unites States are already using Clockwise.MD's online
      scheduling and check-in to manage patient expectations and streamline the waiting process.
      Allowing patients to make urgent care appointments online gives them control of their own
      waiting experience, while virtual queuing provides transparency into waiting status - not
      just for your online schedulers, but for walk-in patients as well.

            Allow patients to reserve a time slot online, provide information about the cause of
            their visit, and select a provider, if applicable. Patients will receive a text message
            when it’s time to check in. Not only will your staff be prepared for their visit — the
            patient has the option to wait from home, the office, or even a nearby coffee shop.

            <h6>Provide transparency into wait times.</h6>
            91% of patients indicate that waiting longer than expected is the most frustrating
            thing about medical facilities. Cut down on this frustration by providing transparency
            into wait times via text message notifications and an in-lobby TV broadcasting current
            wait times and queue order (in a HIPAA-compliant format).
