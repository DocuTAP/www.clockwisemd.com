    <h4>Online self-scheduling and check-in for your urgent care clinic.</h4>
    <p>
      Over 1,300 urgent cares across the Unites States are already using Clockwise.MD's online
      scheduling and check-in to manage patient expectations and streamline the waiting process.
      Allowing patients to make urgent care appointments online gives them control of their own
      waiting experience, while virtual queuing provides transparency into waiting status - not
      just for your online schedulers, but for walk-in patients as well.

            Allow patients to reserve a time slot online, provide information about the cause of
            their visit, and select a provider, if applicable. Patients will receive a text message
            when it’s time to check in. Not only will your staff be prepared for their visit — the
            patient has the option to wait from home, the office, or even a nearby coffee shop.

            91% of patients indicate that waiting longer than expected is the most frustrating
            thing about medical facilities. Cut down on this frustration by providing transparency
            into wait times via text message notifications and an in-lobby TV broadcasting current
            wait times and queue order (in a HIPAA-compliant format).

            Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
            option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
            ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
            real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

            We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
            now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
            in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
            effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

            Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
            text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
            anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
            all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
            our wait times.
