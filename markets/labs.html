            <h6>Manage online, call center, &amp; referral-based scheduling.</h6>
            Catering to a mixed environment of pre-scheduled and walk-in patients can be
            challenging. Clockwise.MD supports call center, online, and referral-based scheduling,
            so that every type of patient gets the most appropriate care needed.

            <h6>Communicate with patients in real time.</h6>
            With automated SMS text messaging and email communications, it's easy to keep patients
            up-to-date on the status of their appointment. Trigger text alerts based on delays or
            time intervals so that patients know exactly when to show up for their appointments.

            <h6>Be proactive about service recovery.</h6>
            Get instant feedback from patients via short text message surveys sent after discharge.
            Real-time notifications of negative feedback make it easy to reach out before any
            damage can be done to your reputation.

            Flexible scheduling and transparency into wait times make it possible to balance
            patient volume between peak and non-peak operating hours. Cut down on long waits,
            avoid bottlenecks, and prevent network leakage with proactive appointment scheduling.

            <h6>Provide transparency into the waiting process.</h6>
            91% of patients indicate that waiting longer than expected is the most frustrating
            thing about medical facilities. Prevent patients from leaving in frustration with
            real-time wait time projections. Text message notifications and an in-lobby TV keep
            patients up to date on wait times and queue order.
