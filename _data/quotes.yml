    Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
    option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
    ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
    real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

    We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
    now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
    in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
    effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

    I cant say enough about the survey functionality of clockwise and its part in our
    clinics' success. The text message survey allows us to respond in real time to patients
    to understand and ease the concerns of those who have had a less than stellar experience.

    Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
    text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
    anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
    all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
    our wait times.

    Clockwise has revolutionized the way we conduct business in our clinics. It is simple,
    efficient, and easy to use. It has increased our efficiency and taken our customer
    service to a new level.
