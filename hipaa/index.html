      <p>See the finer grain details of how we comply with HIPAA below. These are mapped to specific HIPAA rules.
        There’s a lot here but again, we are taking this responsibility on so that our customers don’t have to.
        Controls marked with an (Req) are <em>Required</em>. Controls marked with an (A) are <em>Addressable</em>.
        In our environment, controls outlined below are implemented on all infrastructure that processes, stores,
        transmits or can otherwise gain access to ePHI (electronic protected health information). If have questions,
        please <a href="mailto:security@clockwisemd.com">email us</a>.</p>

      <p>Taken directly from the wording of the Security Rule, administrative safeguards are
        <em>administrative actions, and policies and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation,
          and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct
          of the covered entity’s workforce in relation to the protection of that information.</em></p>
      <p>There aren’t specific security settings in this section, and the most important area covered is the risk
        assessment. The risk assessment is a fundamental process for any organization that wants to become compliant.</p>

      <p>DocuTAP, Inc. has a risk management policy that defines the risk analysis and risk management
        process. This policy is operationalized with processes to conduct regularly risk assessments. Clockwise.MD
        uses NIST800-30 and 800-26 for performing risk analysis. Our policy begins with an inventory of all Clockwise.MD
        systems, mapping of where ePHI is processed, transmitted, or stored, identification of threats, risks,
        and likelihood, and the mitigation of risks. Policies address risk inherent within the environment and
        mitigating the risk to an acceptable and reasonable level.</p>
      <p>Clockwise.MD has a Sanction Policy that has sanctions for employees not adhering to certain policies, and
        for specifically violating HIPAA rules.</p>
      <p>Policies and procedures address the requirements of monitoring and logging system level events and actions
        taken by individuals within the environment. All requests into and out of the Clockwise.MD network are
        logged, as well as all system events. Clockwise.MD, has implemented multiple logging and monitoring solutions
        to track events within their environment and to monitor for certain types of behavior. Log data is regularly
        reviewed. Additionally, proactive alerts are enabled and triggered based on certain suspicious activity.</p>

        to submit an authorization form that is signed and acknowledges their responsibility of safeguarding ePHI.
        The form must also be approved by the Security Officer. Once signed and approved, then the individual will
        be provisioned access to systems deemed business necessary. All Access to ePHI is based on minimum necessary
        requirements and least privilege.</p>
      <p>Clockwise.MD policies define the immediate removal of access once an employee has been terminated, with the
        Security Officer responsible for terminating the access. Once HR initiates the termination process the

      <p>These requirements simply outline the need for business associate agreements (BAAs) between covered entities
        and business associates. This requirement has recently been extended to require business associate agreements
        between business associates and all subcontractors. That linking, chaining together of of BAAs, has created
        for new and interesting legal and business questions. Basically, each layer in the chain of BAAs takes
        on certain responsibilities and certain risks as part of HIPAA, and there needs to be consistency. Case
        in point, at Clockwise.MD we have several customers that have moved over from compliant IaaS providers
        because those providers had breach notification timelines that were not acceptable for large healthcare
        enterprises. We’ve taken a proactive approach to BAAs to mitigate risk for our customers and assure consistency
        along the chain of BAAs.</p>
