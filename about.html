    <h3>Meet the Clockwise.MD Team</h3>
    <p>
      Clockwise.MD was founded in 2012 when a group of seasoned healthcare information technology
      entrepreneurs began applying customer-centric tools used successfully in other industries to
      the healthcare industry. The goal was to arm providers with the tools they needed to improve
      the overall patient experience. Today, Clockwise.MD's online scheduling and virtual queuing
      functionalities are used by more than 1,300 urgent care clinics, emergency departments,
      primary and specialty care clinics, radiology labs, and more to help boost patient
      satisfaction, manage online reputations, and improve patient retention.
