        <h3>Increase patient retention. Improve your online reputation. It's a win-win.</h3>
        <p>
          Up to 92% of today's consumers are putting their trust in online reviews, meaning that
          healthcare providers need to carefully monitor their online presence - if they're not
          already. Fortunately, Clockwise.MD provides simple patient satisfaction surveys that make
          it easy to stay on top of your online brand. Here's how it works: after each visit,
          patients receive a short text message survey about their experience. Depending on whether
          a positive or negative response is submitted, patients will either be encouraged to post
          about their experience online or flagged for immediate follow-up, allowing you to address
          negative experiences before any damage is done to your reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers using Clockwise.MD Survey see an average response rate of 35%, with 75% of
          patients providing feedback within two hours of discharge.

            Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
            option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
            ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
            real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

            We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
            now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
            in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
            effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

            Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
            text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
            anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
            all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
            our wait times.
