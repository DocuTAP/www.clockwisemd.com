        <h3>Increase patient retention. Improve your online reputation. It's a win-win.</h3>
        <p>
          Up to 92% of today's consumers are putting their trust in online reviews, meaning that
          healthcare providers need to carefully monitor their online presence - if they're not
          already. Fortunately, Clockwise.MD provides simple patient satisfaction surveys that make
          it easy to stay on top of your online brand. Here's how it works: after each visit,
          patients receive a short text message survey about their experience. Depending on whether
          a positive or negative response is submitted, patients will either be encouraged to post
          about their experience online or flagged for immediate follow-up, allowing you to address
          negative experiences before any damage is done to your reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers using Clockwise.MD Survey see an average response rate of 35%, with 75% of
          patients providing feedback within two hours of discharge.
