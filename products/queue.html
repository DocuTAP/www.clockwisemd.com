        <h3>Introducing a "fast pass" for healthcare.</h3>
        <p>
          It's no secret that long wait times at medical facilities can severely impact the patient
          experience - and not in a good way. Unfortunately, those waits can feel even longer when
          elements like uncertainty or unfairness come into play, causing patients to consider
          alternatives outside of your practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clockwise.MD's virtual queuing solution empowers urgent cares, emergency rooms, primary
          and specialty care providers, laboratory clinics, and more to put the patient back in
          control. By giving patients the ability to self-schedule appointments online and wait
          from the comfort of their home or a nearby coffee shop, youâ€™re creating a patient-centric
          workflow that has been proven to boost patient satisfaction and increase retention rates.

            Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
            option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
            ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
            real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

            We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
            now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
            in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
            effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

            Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
            text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
            anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
            all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
            our wait times.

            clinics' success. The text message survey allows us to respond in real time to patients
