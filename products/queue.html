        <h3>Introducing a "fast pass" for healthcare.</h3>
        <p>
          It's no secret that long wait times at medical facilities can severely impact the patient
          experience - and not in a good way. Unfortunately, those waits can feel even longer when
          elements like uncertainty or unfairness come into play, causing patients to consider
          alternatives outside of your practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clockwise.MD's virtual queuing solution empowers
          <a href='/markets/urgent-care/'>urgent cares</a>,
          <a href='/markets/emergency-rooms/'>emergency rooms</a>,
          <a href='/markets/scheduled-care/'>primary and specialty care providers</a>,
          <a href='/markets/labs/'>laboratory clinics</a>, and more to put the patient back in
          control. By giving patients the ability to self-schedule appointments online and wait
          from the comfort of their home or a nearby coffee shop, you're creating a patient-centric
          workflow that has been proven to boost patient satisfaction and
          <a href='/products/survey/'>increase retention rates</a>.
