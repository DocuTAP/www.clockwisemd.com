        <h3>Maximize efficiency and minimize stress with simple patient paging.</h3>
        <p>
          Large or complex medical facilities can often overwhelm an already stressed patient,
          leading to confusion and anxiety over the status of their appointment and the
          appropriate site for care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clockwise.MD's Patient Paging system helps patients navigate complex health systems with
          ease - without the need for bulky and expensive pagers. By sending templated messages to
          patients to let them know where to be and when, providers are able to maximize operational
          efficiency, save time, and reduce patient anxiety. These customizable SMS text messages
          instantly notify patients of the status of their wait, helping to improve patient
          satisfaction by thoroughly communicating appointment status and location details at the
          individual patient level.
