            Our patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urgent Care have been thrilled with the
            option to wait at home rather than in our waiting room to be seen by a provider. The
            ability for them to make online reservations through our website program has been a
            real satisfier and we have seen that objectively through our patient satisfaction scores.

            We were able to integrate online check-in into our workflow with minimal effort and
            now our patients can not only see how long their wait time will be but they can sign
            in to the queue online and essentially avoid the waiting room altogether. We now have
            effective tools for managing expectations and give patients the information they desire.

            Allowing patients to wait in the comfort of their home or office and receive automated
            text messages has improved overall client satisfaction. An added benefit we did not
            anticipate is how online scheduling has improved employee morale... instead of patients
            all walking in at the same time they make appointments online which allows us to manage
            our wait times.

            I cant say enough about the survey functionality of clockwise and its part in our
            clinics' success. The text message survey allows us to respond in real time to patients
            to understand and ease the concerns of those who have had a less than stellar experience.
